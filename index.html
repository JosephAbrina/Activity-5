              <h2>Kamui Raikiri</h2>
              <p>Kamui Raikiri is the strongest known Jutsu of Kakashi Hatake. Combining the powers of Kamui with that of a Raikiri enhanced with Six Paths chakra, Kakashi was able to create a surefire technique powerful enough to injure even the likes of Kaguya Otsutsuki.

                This technique is extremely fast and at the same time, cannot be countered. Unfortunately, Kakashi only had access to it for as long as he had Obito's powers within his body.

              <h2>Susanoo
              </h2>
              <p>After gaining access to both Mangekyo Sharingan during the Fourth Great Ninja War, Kakashi Hatake also managed to awaken the powers of the Susanoo.

                Powered by the Six Paths chakra of Obito, this Susanoo was stronger than most others seen in the series. Since it also had the powers of Kamui, Kakashi's Susanoo was known to be incredibly powerful and it could even put up a fight against Kaguya Otsutsuki.</p>

              <h2>Raiden
              </h2>
              <p>Kakashi, being a master of lightning release ninjutsu, is able to perform high-level techniques without any trouble, Raiden being one of them. When used, Kakashi creates a shadow-clone and connects two lightning cutters with a strong of lightning which is then used to electrocute the opponent. Although it's rank isn't known, it is a combination of two S-Ranked techniques, meaning it is quite powerful itself.</p>

              <h2>Kamui
              </h2>
              <p>Kamui is the Mangekyo Sharingan ability of Obito Uchiha. Kakashi, having obtained one Sharingan eye from Obito, gained access to this ability during the Third Great Ninja War, however, he didn't learn how to use it until much later. When performed, Kakashi gained the ability to warp anything within a short range from him to the dimension of Kamui. As expected, this Jutsu is one of Kakashi's strongest to date.</p>

              <h2>Shiden</h2>
              <p>Shiden, also known as Purple Electricity, is one of the strongest and newest techniques of Kakashi Hatake. After losing his Sharingan during the Fourth Great Ninja War, Kakashi could no longer rely on the Raikiri or the Chidori.

                Instead, he developed a stronger technique, known as Shiden, which he could use from a distance. Like Raikiri, this technique is extremely powerful and can tear through the limbs of someone as mighty as a Tailed Beast.</p>

              <h2>Raikiri</h2>
              <p>Raikiri, nicknamed Lightning Cutter, is the signature technique of Kakashi Hatake and a better version of the Chidori. Like the Chidori, the Raikiri is a thrust-based technique that relies on speed and penetration power to end the enemy instantly.

                However, unlike the Chidori, this Jutsu appears to be much more concentrated, making it hit all the harder and faster. While the Chidori is an A-ranked Jutsu, the Raikiri is an S-ranked Jutsu.</p>
